# Bhojpuri-Morph Annotated Data (BHO-Morph)

# Introduction

The [Bhojpuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhojpuri_language) monolingual corpus was taken from [BHLTR](https://github.com/shashwatup9k/bho-resources) project. It was intially initiated by [Atul](https://www.nuigalway.ie/science-engineering/staff-profiles/atulkumarojha/). The Bhojpuri morphological annotated data is prepaired
jointly by [Panlingua Language Processing LLP](http://panlingua.co.in/), [IIT-KGP](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) and [KMI-Agra](https://www.ctrans.in/departments/linguistics).
